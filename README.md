# Recursive-Digit-Sum-ALGO The superDigit function finds a single-digit number by repeatedly summing all digits of a number until only one digit remains.
If the number n is repeated k times, instead of actually repeating it, we multiply the sum of its digits by k to get the same result more efficiently.
